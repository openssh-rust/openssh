/// TODO: RENAME THIS INTO THE NEXT VERSION BEFORE RELEASE
/// ## Changed

pub mod unreleased {}

/// ## Changed
///  - Use `str::rfind` to locate the `@` in connection string in case the username contains `@`
pub mod v0_10_2 {}

/// ## Added
///  - Add new fns [`Session::arc_command`], [`Session::arc_raw_command`],
///    [`Session::to_command`], and [`Session::to_raw_command`] to support
///    session-owning commands
///  - Add generic [`crate::OwningCommand`], to support session-owning
///    commands.
///  - Add [`crate::child::Child`] as a generic version of [`RemoteChild`]
///    to support session-owning commands
/// ## Changed
///  - Change [`RemoteChild`] to be an alias to [`crate::child::Child`]
///    owning a session references.
///  - Change [`Command`] to be an alias to [`OwningCommand`] owning a
///    session reference.
///  - Change [`OverSsh::over_ssh`] to be generic and support owned
///    sessions.

pub mod v0_10_1 {}

/// ## Added
///  - [`Session::new_process_mux`]
///  - [`Session::new_native_mux`]
///  - [`SessionBuilder::get_user`]
///  - [`SessionBuilder::get_port`]
///  - [`SessionBuilder::resolve`]
///  - [`SessionBuilder::launch_master`]
///  - [`SessionBuilder::clean_history_control_directory`]
///  - [`OverSsh`] for converting [`std::process::Command`],
///    [`tokio::process::Command`] or other custom types to
///    [`Command`].
/// ## Changed
///  - [`Socket::TcpSocket`] now contains `host: Cow<'_, str>` and `port: u16`
///    instead of an already resolved `SocketAddr`.
///    Since the socket could be opened on remote host, which might has
///    different dns configuration, it's better to delay resolution and perform
///    it on remote instead.
///  - [`Socket::new`] now takes `host: Cow<'_, str>` and `port: u16` for the
///    same reason as above.
pub mod v0_10_0 {}

/// ## Added
///  - Add new fn `SessionBuilder::ssh_auth_sock`

///  - [`Session::request_port_forward`] now takes `impl Into<...>`
///    to make it much easier to use.

///  - [`Session::resume`]
///  - [`Session::resume_mux`]
///  - [`Session::detach`]
pub mod v0_9_3 {}

/// ## Changed
///  - Removed `impl From<OwnedFd> for Stdio` as it was an unintentional part of the public API.
///    This is technically a breaking change, but should in practice affect no-one.

/// ## Added
///  - [`Session::subsystem`]

pub mod v0_9_0_rc2 {}

/// ## Added
///  - Feature flag `native-mux`, an alternative backend that communicates
///    with the ssh multiplex server directly through control socket as opposed
///    `process-mux` implementation that spawns a process to communicate with
///    the ssh multiplex server.
///
///    Compared to `process-mux`, `native-mux` provides more robust error
///    reporting, better performance and reduced memory usage.
///
///    `process-mux` checks the exit status of `ssh` for indication of error,
///    then parse the output of it and the output of the ssh multiplex master
///    to return an error.
///
///    This method is obviously not so robust as `native-mux`, which directly
///    communicates with ssh multiplex master through its [multiplex protocol].
///
///  - Feature flag `process-mux` (enabled by default) to disable the old
///    backend if desired.
///  - API [`Session::connect_mux`] for the new `native-mux` backend,
///    which is used to create a [`Session`] backed by `native-mux`
///    implementation.
///  - API [`SessionBuilder::connect_mux`] for the new `native-mux` backend,
///    which is used to create a [`Session`] backed by `native-mux`
///    implementation.
///  - [`Session::request_port_forward`] for local/remote forwarding
///    of tcp or unix stream sockets, along with [`ForwardType`] and
///    [`Socket`], which is used to setup port forwarding.
///  - A new module [`process`] is added to provide interfaces more similar to
///    [`std::process`].
///  - New variants are added to [`Error`].
///
/// ## Changed
///  - A new type [`Stdio`] is used for setting stdin/stdout/stderr.
///  - [`ChildStdin`], [`ChildStdout`] and [`ChildStderr`] are now aliases
///    for [`tokio_pipe::PipeRead`] and [`tokio_pipe::PipeWrite`].
///  - [`Command::spawn`] and [`Command::status`] now conforms to
///    [`std::process::Command`] and [`tokio::process::Command`], in which
///    stdin, stdout and stderr are inherit by default.
///  - [`Command::spawn`] is now an `async` method.
///  - [`RemoteChild::wait`] now takes `self` by value.
///  - [`Error`] is now marked `#[non_exhaustive]`.
///
