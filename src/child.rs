/// Representation of a running or exited remote child process.
///
/// This structure is used to represent and manage remote child processes. A remote child process
/// is created via the [`Command`](crate::Command) struct through [`Session::command`], which
/// configures the spawning process and can itself be constructed using a builder-style interface.
///
/// Calling [`wait`](RemoteChild::wait) (or other functions that wrap around it) will make the
/// parent process wait until the child has actually exited before continuing.
///
/// Unlike [`std::process::Child`], `RemoteChild` *does* implement [`Drop`], and will terminate the
/// local `ssh` process corresponding to the remote process when it goes out of scope. Note that
/// this does _not_ terminate the remote process. If you want to do that, you will need to kill it
/// yourself by executing a remote command like `pkill` to kill it on the remote side.
///
/// As a result, `RemoteChild` cannot expose `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` as fields for
/// split-borrows like [`std::process::Child`] does. Instead, it exposes
/// [`stdin`](RemoteChild::stdin), [`stdout`](RemoteChild::stdout),
/// and [`stderr`](RemoteChild::stderr) as methods. Callers can call `.take()` to get the same
/// effect as a split borrow and use multiple streams concurrently. Note that for the streams to be
/// available,`Stdio::piped()` should be passed to the corresponding method on
/// [`Command`](crate::Command).
///
/// NOTE that once `RemoteChild` is dropped, any data written to `stdin` will not be sent to the
/// remote process and `stdout` and `stderr` will yield EOF immediately.
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn foo() {
/// # let child: openssh::RemoteChild<'static> = unimplemented!();
/// let stdin = child.stdin().take().unwrap();
/// let stdout = child.stdout().take().unwrap();
/// tokio::io::copy(&mut stdout, &mut stdin).await;
