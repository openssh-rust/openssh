Scriptable SSH through OpenSSH.

This crate wraps the OpenSSH remote login client (`ssh` on most machines), and provides
a convenient mechanism for running commands on remote hosts. Since all commands are executed
through the `ssh` command, all your existing configuration (e.g., in `.ssh/config`) should
continue to work as expected.

The library's API is modeled closely after that of [`std::process::Command`], since `ssh` also
attempts to make the remote process seem as much as possible like a local command.

### Run integration tests

Requires `docker` and [`cargo-hack`].

Check [getting Docker guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on how to install docker,
and use `cargo install cargo-hack` to install [`cargo-hack`].

```
./run_ci_tests.sh
```

It will create a container which runs sshd, setup ssh-agent, and environment variables
that are required to run the integration tests.

It will also test different combination of feature flags to ensure they all compile without error.

[`cargo-hack`]: https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack

### Build documentation

Requires nightly cargo.

To install nightly cargo, run `rustup toolchain install nightly`.

```
./build_doc.sh
```
